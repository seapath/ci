== List of supported equipment
[.center]

* Vendor X
** <<Board Y>>
** <<Board Z>>

== Testing Setup
=== Setup Information
* Retrieve system information:
  ** Kernel version and configuration
  ** Boot options
  ** CPU information
  ** Memory information
  ** Network interfaces

=== System Capabilities
* Virtualization:
  ** Check processor support for hardware virtualization technologies (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
  ** Ensure hardware virtualization is enabled in UEFI settings
  ** Verify KVM kernel module is enabled

* Network:
  ** Ensure network drivers are operational
  ** Verify SEAPATH's network infrastructure tools, such as OpenVSwitch, are operational

=== Hardening & ABP-28 Compliance

=== Virtual Machine Deployment
* Deploy and test two VMs:
  ** One real-time and isolated
  ** One non-real-time and non-isolated
* Use VMs for:
  ** Real-time (cyclic test)
  ** SV IEC61850 packet network latency tests

=== Cyclic Testing
* Employ Cyclictest to measure real-time system latency:
  ** Run on isolated CPUs
  ** Determine worst-case latencies

=== Network Latency Testing
* Perform SV IEC61850 packet network latency tests
* Compute latency between publisher and VM system clocks
