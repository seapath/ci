* SFL
** <<SEAPATH CI>>

<<<
== Testing Setup
=== Setup Information
* Retrieve system information:
  ** Kernel version and configuration
  ** Boot options
  ** CPU information
  ** Memory information
  ** Network interfaces

=== System Capabilities
* Virtualization:
  ** Check processor support for hardware virtualization technologies (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
  ** Ensure hardware virtualization is enabled in UEFI settings
  ** Verify KVM kernel module is enabled

* Network:
  ** Ensure network drivers are operational
  ** Verify SEAPATH's network infrastructure tools, such as OpenVSwitch, are operational

* Real-time:
  ** Employ Cyclictest to measure real-time system latency:
    *** Run on isolated CPUs
    *** Determine worst-case latencies

* Clustering:
  ** If the machine is part of a cluster

* Update:
  ** Ensure that the system is upgradable using SWUpdate

=== Hardening & ANSSI-BP28 Compliance
* Launch SEAPATH cybersecurity tests
* Verify compliance with ANSSI-BP28 requirements
* Complete lists of requirements on SEAPATH https://wiki.lfenergy.org/display/SEAP/SEAPATH+and+cybersecurity[on the wiki].

=== Virtual Machine Deployment
* Deploy and test two VMs:
  ** One real-time and isolated
  ** One non-real-time and non-isolated
* Use VMs for:
  ** Real-time (cyclic test)
  ** SV IEC61850 packet network latency tests

=== IEC61850 Sampled Value Latency Testing
* Perform SV IEC61850 packet network latency tests
* Compute latency between publisher and userspace of VM

== About this documentation

This documentation uses the AsciiDoc documentation generator. It is a convenient
format that allows using plain-text formatted writing that can later be
converted to various output formats such as HTML and PDF.

In order to generate an HTML version of this documentation, use the following
command (the asciidoc package will need to be installed in your Linux
distribution):

  $ asciidoc test-report.adoc

This will result in a README.html file being generated in the current directory.

If you prefer a PDF version of the documentation instead, use the following
command (the dblatex package will need to be installed on your Linux
distribution):

  $ asciidoctor-pdf test-report.adoc
