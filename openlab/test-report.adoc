== Introduction
The purpose of this document is to certify the correct operation of the open source real-time operating system for virtualizing IEDs: SEAPATH, a project under the governance of the Linux Foundation Energy.

A series of tests has been carried out on a range of equipment from several vendors, in order to certify SEAPATH on them. Certified in virtualization functions, security, real-time functionality and network latency of IEC61850 Sampled Values.

==== System Capabilities and Hardening

* Purpose of the tests
  ** Virtualization
    *** Check processor support for hardware virtualization technologies (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
    *** Ensure hardware virtualization is enabled in UEFI settings
    *** Verify KVM kernel module is enabled
  ** Network
    *** Ensure network drivers are operational
    *** Verify SEAPATH's network infrastructure tools, such as OpenVSwitch, are operational
  ** Clustering
    *** If the machine is part of a cluster
  ** Update
    *** Ensure that the system is upgradable using SWUpdate

==== Virtual Machine (VM) Deployment

* Purpose of the tests
  ** Deploy and test two VMs
    *** One real-time and isolated
    *** One non-real-time and non-isolated
  ** Use VMs for
    *** Real-time (cyclic test)
    *** SV IEC61850 packet network latency tests

==== Real-time testing (Cyclictest)
* Purpose of the test
  ** Employ Cyclictest to measure real-time system latency
    *** Run on isolated CPUs
    *** Determine worst-case latencies

The following command is launched:
[,bash]

== About this documentation

This documentation uses the AsciiDoc documentation generator. It is a convenient
format that allows using plain-text formatted writing that can later be
converted to various output formats such as HTML and PDF.

In order to generate an HTML version of this documentation, use the following
command (the asciidoc package will need to be installed in your Linux
distribution):

  $ asciidoc test-report.adoc

This will result in a README.html file being generated in the current directory.

If you prefer a PDF version of the documentation instead, use the following
command (the dblatex package will need to be installed on your Linux
distribution):

  $ asciidoctor-pdf test-report.adoc
